//! A collection of utilities used by our other crypto libraries. Some examples are Pedersen commitment,
//! Elgamal encryption, some finite field utilities like inner product, weighted inner product, hadamard product,
//! etc, multiscalar multiplication (MSM) like Fixed Base MSM, polynomial utilities like multiplying polynomials,
//! creating polynomial from roots, etc, efficient way of checking several pairing relations in a single multi-pairing.
