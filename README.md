# Threshold BBS+
This code is implemented for the threshold signing protocols of our work and the state-of-the-art work WMC24. The code of the signing protocol of DKL+23 is forked from the existing implementation.
We provide instructions for running experiments in our work and two methods for deploying our code:
1. Using Docker to directly run the experiments without configuring the environment.
2. Configuring and deploying our code on macOS.
